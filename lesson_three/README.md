# Created Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Count sort in sort.cc

Explanation: Created a function for each algorithm. For quick sort I have split the finction in to 2, one is called partision which is dynamically called.

Input: when excuting the program it takes the 2nd argument as an input which will indicate the size

Output: It will show failure if the sort has not been done correctly and shows the excuted time when it works correctly
